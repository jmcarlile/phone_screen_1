Q: Explain how to implement authentication in a full stack app.

A: Main points:
    Signup:
 Form for sign up on front end, endpoint for sign-up on back end creates row for user in database. 

    Login:
form submission of login form, enpoint for login on backend checks to see if username exists in table and if hashed+salted password matches
the encrpyted password using library like bcrpyt

    Persistance:
for items like shopping cart there needs to be a user session on the backend and a cookie on the front end that is passed with each request.
